# The many definitions of the many body localized phase
In the first post of this series, we have seen...
There are however closed quantum systems for which the ETH does not hold: systems which are not thermal at all.
These non-thermalizing systems are called many body localized (MBL).
This fist definition of the MBL systems is not very practical.
Here is a list of more practical definitions
* LIOMs
* Entropy
* Level statisctics

The paradox is only apparent. When we say that a quantum system thermalizes, we mean that its physical, macroscopic observables obey Boltzmann laws. 
So, we do not need the density matrix to converge to Boltzmann, but to act on physical observables *as if* it had thermalized:
\\[
	\lim_{t \to \infty} \langle \hat{O} \rangle(t) = \text{tr}(\hat{\rho}^\text{Boltzmann}(\beta) \hat{O}).
\\]
